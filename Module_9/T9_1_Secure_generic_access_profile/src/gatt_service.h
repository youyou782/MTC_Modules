/**
 * @brief A GattService class which allows managing its characteristics
 * using C++ containers, smart pointers and templates.
 *
 * The class is designed so that
 * 1. The caller adds as many characteristics as desired.
 * 2. Creates the service.
 * 3. Registers the service to the (system's) GattServer instance
 *
 * IMPORTANT::
 * This class uses C++ containers, C++ templates, and smart pointers.
 * If you are not familiar with these, first check the container Module in Part I.
 * For templates and smart pointers, see the Advanced C++ concepts module.
 *
 * @note std::vector stores its elements in contiguous memory region. Therefore,
 * an address of its first element can be used as an C array.
 *
 * @details Mbed OS GattService and GattCharacteristic classes have some non-trivial
 * assumptions about their member life spans. For example, when constructing a characteristic
 * attributes are copied from the constructor arguments, but later managed (copying and/or moving)
 * to the memory that is managed by the stack. Therefore, it is developer's responsibility to
 * make sure that the constructor arguments are valid till the stack moves/copies the
 * arguments to the stack.
 *
 * This class ensures that the memory remains intact.
 *
 * NOTE: This class cannot be copied since _service is stored as std::unique_ptr
